HttpURLConnection is another class just like URL -- it's part of the same Java toolbox (java.net.package). It is a sub-class of URLConnection. It
is used for HTTP connections.

By casting to HttpURLConnection, you're unlocking a toolbox of HTTP features that a generic connection doesnâ€™t give you.
There are the tools that HttpURLConnection provides a coder with:

| Method                               | What it does                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setRequestMethod("GET")`            | Set the type of HTTP request (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)                     |
| `getResponseCode()`                  | Get the HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)                 |
| `getInputStream()`                   | Read the actual response body (like article text)                      |
| `connect()`                          | Manually open the connection (optional if you call `getInputStream()`) |
| `disconnect()`                       | Close the connection when you're done                                  |
| `setRequestProperty("key", "value")` | Set HTTP headers (like `User-Agent`)                                   |
| `setDoOutput(true)`                  | Used for POST requests when you want to send data                      |


ANALOGY
URL: Knows the address of the house you want to visit
HttpURLConnection: The phone call or door knock to that house saying: "Hey, I am here -- can we talk?"

So,
URL url = new URL(...);                                                                 // You have the address
HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) wikiURL.openConnection();            // You knock and open the line

Ques. What is HttpURLConnection?
It is a class in Java used to:
-   Connect to websites
-   Send/Receive data using HTTP (web requests)
-   Read response codes, headers, and body 

Ques. Explain the syntax - HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); 
Why is it not like - HttpURLConnection url = new HttpURLConnection(...);
-   It is because- it is abstract class.
        What is abstract class?
        -   An abstract class is like a template, not something you can directly build.
    Java says: "You can't say new HttpURLConnection(...) because it's incomplete. I (Java) will decide that exact type to give you 
    based on the website you're connecting to."

    So what really happening here is:
    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
    -   url.openConnection()
        This is a method from the URL class. It says: Hey Java, give me the right kind of connection to this URL.
        This connection might be:
        -   An HttpURLConnection (for http:// or https://)
        -   A FileURLConnection (for file://)
        -   Or something else java decides
        So Java returns a generic URLConnection. And, we will cast it to whatever url it is.
        Once you have casted- Java says- "Go ahead. You now have full access to HTTP tools. Use them wisely."
