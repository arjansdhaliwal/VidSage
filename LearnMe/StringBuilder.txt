StringBuilder is a Java Class used to build a long String efficiently.
It is like a notebook where you keep adding pages of text as you read them.
Much better than using String + String repeatedly, because that creates multiple string copies in memory (whic is slow and wastefull).

Why we need it?
We are reading the response line by line using BufferedReader. Each line contains part of the JSON data. We want to combiine all the lines 
into one complete string. StringBuilder is the perfect tool for this.

Simple visual:
Before reading:
        responseBuilder = ""
        Line 1: "{"
        Line 2:   "  \"query\" {"
        Line 3:     "     ..."
After reading:
        responseBuilder = "{\n   \"query\" {\n     ..."

BAD PRACTICE:
String response = "";
response += reader.readLine();
