The URL Class is part of Java.net Package.
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which means: A text that tells us where something is on the internet.

Java wraps the text into smart object that understands:
-   How to connect to it
-   What its parts are
-   How to use it safely in your code

import java.net.URL;
This tells java: I want to use your build-in class that knows how to handle web addresses.

Ques. What does the URL class do?
-   It takes the web address string like: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", and turns into an object that can do smart things like:
        Method                              What it tells you
        getProtocol()                       "https"
        getHost()                           "en.wikipedia.org"
        getPath()                           "/wiki/Canada"
        getQuery()                          "null (only appears if URL has ?key=value)
        openConnection()                    Opens a door so you can start talking to the site

-   Code Example
import java.net.URL;

pulbic class TestURL{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        URL url = new URL ("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada");

        System.out.println("Protocol: " + url.getProtocol());
        System.out.println("Host: " + url.getHost());
        System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath())l=;
    }
}

Output-
Protocol: https
Host: en.wikipedia.org
Path: /wiki/Canada

So you're not just storing text â€” you're storing a real, dissectable address.

Ques. URL url = new URL(String);
-   The string we have which is url. The system does not know already that it is Url. To let the system know we need to pass that String, so 
Java can know that it is url not a simple string. After passing string from this class, Java will be easily to dessect the url and can know
what is protocol, what is host and all needed little things.

Ques. openConnection(); What is it?
If your URL is:
-   http://... or https://... -> It gives you a connection to a website
-   file://... -> It gives you a conection to a file
-   ftp://... -> It gives you a connection to an FTP server
